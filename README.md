## Sincere Request
Since we have developed our solution in office's laptops but due to time limit, we are not able to replicate full code in Git. And due to IT policy restriction in our office, we could not share our full code to out of office premises.
We have tried to show our efforts in demo video. Please refer here https://youtu.be/WE87ltnuUMM.  Please don't disqualify our solution based on this code. We have requested to office IT for transfer code, but it will take few days. If you give us some time, we can provide full solution in few days.
Thank you for your support.

##Note###


Since we have developed our solution in office's laptops but due to time limit we are not able to replicate full code in Git.
And due to IT policy restriction in our office , we could not share our full code to out of office premises.
We have tried to show the our efforts in demo vedio. Please refere there. Please don't disqualify our solution based on this code
We have requested to office IT for transfer code but it will take few days. If you give us sometime, we can provide full solution in few days.
Thanku for your support.
